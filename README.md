**<a href="https://prokischlab.github.io/GENOMITexplorer/" target="_blank">GENOMITexplorer</a>** is an open access online resource created as part of the study "Diagnosing pediatric mitochondrial disease: lessons from 2,000 exomes" by Stenton et al., (in submission) led by Dr. Holger Prokisch at the Technical University of Munich. It is the result of an international collaboration initiated by the European Network for Mitochondrial Diseases (GENOMIT).

**<a href="https://genomit.eu" target="_blank">GENOMIT</a>** is an E-Rare funded network of partners at established national hubs for the biochemical and genetic diagnosis and care of patients with mitochondriopathies acting in close collaboration with mitochondrial disease patient organizations to improve the diagnosis and care of mitochondrial disease patients.

**All clinicians and researchers contributing data to, or involved in the creation of, GENOMITexplorer are acknowledged <a href="https://prokischlab.github.io/GENOMITexplorer/#Scripts_all_contributors_contributors.html" target="_blank">here</a>.**

The resource contains:

**1) Information on the <a href="https://prokischlab.github.io/GENOMITexplorer/#Scripts_variant_information_study_variants.html" target="_blank">variant-level</a> for all “pathogenic” and “likely pathogenic” variants reported in the study.**

Variants are listed with their respective predicted function, heteroplasmy level (for mitochondrial DNA variants), allele frequency (according to gnomAD), CADD score, SIFT score, ACMG classification, functional evidence, and phenotype semantic similarity score.

**2) Information on HPO-gene associations, on the <a href="https://prokischlab.github.io/GENOMITexplorer/#Scripts_HPO_associations_patient_level.html" target="_blank">patient-level</a> and <a href="https://prokischlab.github.io/GENOMITexplorer/#Scripts_HPO_associations_gene_level.html" target="_blank">gene-level</a>.**

HPO-gene association are provided for all patients included in the study in addition to pediatric molecularly diagnosed patients from mitochondrial disease registries (mitoNET and Besta) and from literature reports.

The most discriminating phenotypes by molecular diagnosis can be explored for all genes with ≥5 reported patients carrying “pathogenic” and “likely pathogenic” variants.

**3) Visualization of the <a href="https://prokischlab.github.io/GENOMITexplorer/#Scripts_WES_study_study_overview.html" target="_blank">study results</a>.**

Depiction of the study overview, molecular genetic diagnoses, mitochondrial disease gene coverage, and clinical presentation of the patients.
