# print the result for each gene</code></pre>
<p>For genes with ≥5 patients the most discriminating phenotypes by molecular diagnosis can be identified by consideration of the odds ratio and p value (derived from Fisher’s exact tests comparing HPO term frequency in patients with the molecular diagnosis of interest vs. all other GENOMITexplorer patients), as below:</p>
<p>The odds ratio provides a measure of association. A higher value indicates stronger association of the phenotype (HPO term) with the molecular diagnosis of interest. If the phenotype is only associated with the molecular diagnosis of interest or is reported in all patients with the molecular diagnosis of interest, the value will be infinite. In addition to the odds ratio itself, the 95% confidence intervals for the odds ratio are given in brackets. The p value provides the significance of the association. A lower value indicates the association of the phenotype (HPO term) with the molecular diagnosis of interest to be more significant.</p>
